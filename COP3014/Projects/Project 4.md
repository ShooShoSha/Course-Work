# Project 4

## Due

* February 28, before 5 PM
* March 3, before 5 PM (for late submissions)

## Objective
Modify project 3 (manipulating an array of up to 20 ints) to use functions.

## Specification
Use a separate function for each of these actions:

* Get the integers from user.
* Display the integers in the array.
* Remove duplicates.
* Sort the array.

Feel free to use any other functions you like. Some utility can make the program
easier to read and debug.

* Function to swap two numbers in the array. (Be careful here!)
* Function to locate a number that should be removed from the array.
* Function to actually remove a number from the array once it is found.
* Any other function you deem is necessary or helpful

Include a comment before each function explaining the purpose of the function.

## Data
`Project4/A.txt`
`Project4/B.txt`
`Project4/C.txt`

## Results
`Project4/RunOutput.txt`

## Suggestions
1. Start with your working code from project 3.
2. Add one function at a time and test it thoroughly.

## Reminder
This is not a group project. You should not show anyone else your code and you 
should not look at anyone else's code. Discuss ideas, not code. If you start
writing code down with someone else, you've gone too far.

## Style and Format
* Be sure to include appropriate documentation (header comments as described in 
Project 1)
* Format your code as discussed in class. For example, curly braces should line 
up and all blocks of code should be indented to appropriate level.

## Submission
* Submit your project using the eLearning dropbox
* Notice that there is a dropbox for late submissions
* For this project simply submit the file containing your source code (.c)
