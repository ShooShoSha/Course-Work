# Project 1

## Due
* January 17, before 5:00PM
* January 20, before 5:00PM (for late submissions)

## Objective
Write a C program that implements the following:

* Declare one variable to store a single character (**char**)
* Declare two variables to store integers (**int**)
* Decalre two variables to store real, floating point numbers (**double**)
* Display appropriate prompts and get the five values from the user
	* one character (upper case), two integers, and two doubles
> Have the user enter the character value first.
* Display the following information with clear messages
	* The character (displayed as a character)
	* The ASCII code for the character (displayed as an integer)
	* The character + 32 (add 32 to the character and display the result as a character)
	* The two integers
	* The average of the two integers (use integer arithmetic and display as an integer)
> If the two integers are 23 and 26, the average should be 24
	* The average of the two integers (use double arithmetic and display as a double)
> If the two integers are 23 and 26, the average should be 24.5
	* The two doubles
	* The average of the two doubles (use integer arithmetic and display as an integer)
	* The average of the two doubles (use double arithmetic and display as a double)
	* The average of all four numbers (use double arithmetic and display as a double)
> Display this last result with **exactly two decimal places, field width of eight**

## Specification
Follow the style described in class.
* Comments at the beginning should include the
	* file name
	* your name
	* course
	* date
	* project number
	* basic purpose of the program
* Opening and closing curly braces should line up vertically 
* The user should always be given a clear prompt when asked to input data
* Any output should include a clear message indicating the meaning of the output

## Grading
Your submission should be similar to the following sample run.

### Input
J
35 38
2.888 3.333

### Output
Character is         : J
ASCII code is        : 74
Character + 32 is    : j

Integers are		 : 35, 38
Average (as int) is	 : 36
Average (as real) is : 36.500000

Reals are            : 2.888000, 3.333000
Average (as int) is  : 2 or 3
Average (as real) is : 3.110500

Average of all is    :    19.81


## Submission
Submit your project using the eLearning dropbox. Notice there is a dropbox for
late submissions.
For this first project, simply submit the file containg your source code (.c)
The program **must** compile and run on a UNIX machine.
