# Project 3

## Due
* February 21, before 5 PM
* February 24, before 5 PM (for late submissions)

## Objective
Write a C program to perform some common array operations.

### Procedure

1. Allow the user to enter up to twenty non-negative integers and store them in an array.
2. Print the numbers (one per line) in the same order they were entered.
3. Remove all duplicate numbers from the list.
4. Repeat step 2 with the duplicates removed.
5. Sort the numbers into ascending order using a bubble sort.
6. Repeat step 2 with the numbers sorted.

## Specification
The user should indicate that all numbers have been entered by entering a 
negative one. If the user enters a negative value (other than -1) you should 
simply ignore that number. If the user enters 20 valid numbers do not prompt 
for more, simply proceed to step 2 above.

DO **NOT** use functions (other than main) for this program.

## Data
[inA.txt](inA.txt)
[inB.txt](inB.txt)
[inC.txt](inC.txt)

## Results
[RunOutput.txt](RunOutput.txt)

## Reminder
This is not a group project. You should not show anyone else your code and you 
should not look at anyone else's code. Discuss ideas, not code. If you start
writing code down with someone else, you've gone too far.

## Style and Format
* Be sure to include appropriate documentation (header comments as described in 
Project 1)
* Format your code as discussed in class. For example, curly braces should line 
up and all blocks of code should be indented to appropriate level.

## Submission
* Submit your project using the eLearning dropbox
* Notice that there is a dropbox for late submissions
* For this project simply submit the file containing your source code (.c)
