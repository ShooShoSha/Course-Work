	Course Description
An introduction to designing solutions toscientific problems. Emphasis on the 
use of basic programmingconstructs to create correct, efficient algorithms. 
Secondary focus on implementationof the algorithms using a current procedural 
language.

	Student Learning Outcomes
Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:
	1.Develop algorithmic solutions to problems,using basic data types, 
	  control constructs, and parameter passing.
	2.Build program solutions that require simple search and sorting 
	  algorithms.
	3.Follow a development process where algorithms are developed before 
	  implementation begins.
	4.Design and implement solutions to problems involving a mathematical or
	  scientific principles.
	5.Analyze solutions for correctness and efficiency.

Topics Covered:
	* Algorithms
	* Pseudocode
	* Parameter Passing
	* Sequences
	* Selection
	* Iteration
	* Algorithm correctness and efficiency
	* Arrays
	* Linear Search
	* Simple Sort

Expectationsfor AcademicConduct/Plagiarism Policy:

As members of the University of West Florida, we commit ourselves to
honesty. As we strive for excellence in performance, integrity-personal
and institutional-is our most precious asset. Honesty in our academic
work is vital, and we will not knowingly act in ways which erode that
integrity. Accordingly, we pledge not to cheat, nor to tolerate
cheating, nor to plagiarize the work of others. We pledge to share
community resources in ways that are responsible and that comply with
established policies of fairness. Cooperation and competition are means
to high achievement and are encouraged. Indeed, cooperation is expected
unless our directive is to individual performance. We will compete
constructively and professionally for the purpose of stimulating high
performance standards. Finally, we accept adherence to this set of
expectations for academic conduct as a condition of membership in the
UWF academic community.

Any occurrence of academic dishonesty, including all forms of cheating
and plagiarism, will be punished by a range of punishments from a grade
of zero on the assignment to expulsion from the university. For more
information, see the UWF Student Handbook (UWF Student Planner and
Handbook <http://www.thezonelive.com/zone/public/6/handbook.asp>).

 

The Student Code of Conduct sets forth the rules, regulations and expected
behavior of students enrolled at the University of West Florida.
Violations of any rules, regulations, or behavioral expectations may
result in a charge of violating the Student Code of Conduct. It is the
student's responsibility to read the Student Code of Conduct and conduct
themselves accordingly.  You may access the current Student Code of
Conduct at  UWF Judicial Affairs <http://www.uwf.edu/osrr/>.

 

Assistance:

Students with special needs who require specific examination-related or
other course-related accommodations should contact the UWF Office of
Disabled Students Services (http://www.uwf.edu/sdrc/ or tel. 850-474-2387). DSS
will provide the student with a letter for the instructor that will specify any
recommended accommodations.

 


          Other Course Policies:

Attendance: Not required, but is strongly encouraged. Students are responsible 
for all announcements and all material covered in class. If you miss a class, 
please ask a classmate for notes to determine what you have missed.

Exams: Make-up exams will NOT be given. Exceptions may be made with a serious, 
documented medical or legal excuse. No make-ups will be given unless students 
make advance arrangements.

Grades: Final grades will be calculated using a standard grade distribution. 
The last day of the term for withdrawal from an individual course with an 
automatic grade of "W" is March 21, 2014. Withdrawals done after that date will
result in a grade of "WF" or withdrawal-failing. Applying for an incomplete or 
"I" grade will be considered only if: (1) there are extenuating circumstances 
to warrant it, AND (2) you have a passing grade and have completed at least 70%
of the course work, AND (3) approval of the department chair.

Participation and Feedback: I encourage active participation and regular 
feedback. I believe that effective communication between the instructor and 
students will make the course more useful, interesting, and productive.
