## Course Description
A first course in Data Structures and Algorithms. Topics will include 
traditional data structures with a major focus on design and analysis of
algorithms and will include projects that stress mathematics and science.
## Prerequisites
* COP3014C (or COP3011) Algorithms and Program Design

## Student Learning Outcomes
Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

* Develop solutions to problems by applying presented algorithms
* Develop solutions that emphasize mathematical and scientific domains
* Write algorithms for solving problems prior to coding
* Analyze solutions in terms of time and space complexity
* Develop programs that utilize the static structures, arrays and `struct`
* Write recursive definitions and develop recursive programming solutions
Develop programs that require dynamic data structures such singly- and doubly-linked lists
* Contrast stacks and queues in both use and implementation
* Explain the run-time stack in terms of function calling sequence, parameter passing and return values
* Analyze and implement search techniques

## Topics Covered
* Algorithms
* Big-O notation and concepts
* Recursion
* Arrays
* `structs`
* Sorting/binary search
* Singly- and doubly-linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Pointers
* Run-time stack
* Math/Science examples and projects

## Grading
* Exams(2) - 20% (each)
* Final Exam: 25%
* Projects: 35%

## Grading Scale
* 93%: **A**

## Expectations for Academic Conduct/Plagiarism Policy:

> As members of the University of West Florida, we commit ourselves to 
honesty. As we strive for excellence in performance, integrity-personal and 
institutional-is our most precious asset. Honesty in our academic work is 
vital, and we will not knowingly act in ways which erode that integrity. 
Accordingly, we pledge not to cheat, nor to tolerate cheating, nor to 
plagiarize the work of others. We pledge to share community resources in ways 
that are responsible and that comply with established policies of fairness. 
Cooperation and competition are means to high achievement and are encouraged. 
Indeed, cooperation is expected unless our directive is to individual 
performance. We will compete constructively and professionally for the purpose 
of stimulating high performance standards. Finally, we accept adherence to 
this set of expectations for academic conduct as a condition of membership in 
the UWF academic community.

> Any occurrence of academic dishonesty, including all forms of cheating and 
plagiarism, will be punished by a range of punishments from a grade of zero on 
the assignment to expulsion from the university. For more information, see the 
[UWF Student Handbook](<http://www.thezonelive.com/zone/public/6/handbook.asp>).

>The Student Code of Conduct sets forth the rules, regulations and expected 
behavior of students enrolled at the University of West Florida. Violations of 
any rules, regulations, or behavioral expectations may result in a charge of 
violating the Student Code of Conduct. It is the student's responsibility to 
read the Student Code of Conduct and conduct themselves accordingly.  You may 
access the current Student Code of Conduct at 
[UWF Judicial Affairs](<http://www.uwf.edu/osrr/>).

## Assistance

> Students with special needs who require specific examination-related or 
other course-related accommodations should contact the 
[UWF Office of Disabled Students Services](http://www.uwf.edu/sdrc/) or by 
telephone (850) 474-2387. DSS will provide the student with a letter for the 
instructor that will specify any recommended accommodations.

## Other Course Policies

### Attendance
Not required, but is strongly encouraged. Students are responsible for all announcements and all material covered in class. If you miss a class, 
please ask a classmate for notes to determine what you have missed.

### Exams
Make-up exams will NOT be given. Exceptions may be made with a serious, 
documented medical or legal excuse. No make-ups will be given unless students 
make advance arrangements.

### Grades
Final grades will be calculated using a standard grade distribution. 
The last day of the term for withdrawal from an individual course with an 
automatic grade of *W* is March 21, 2014. Withdrawals done after that date will
result in a grade of *WF* or withdrawal-failing.
Applying for an incomplete or *I* grade will be considered only if you meet 
**ALL** of the following: 

1. Extenuating circumstances warrant it
2. Have a passing grade
3. Completed at least 70% of the course work
4. Received approval of the department chair

### Participation and Feedback
I encourage active participation and regular feedback. I believe that 
effective communication between the instructor and students will make the course
more useful, interesting, and productive.
