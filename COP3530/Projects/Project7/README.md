# Project 7

## Hashing

### Due
* April 23, before 5:00 PM
* No late submissions

### Objective
Write a C program that implements an address book using a hash table. The
functionality of the address book will be nearly idenitical to 
[Project 6](../Project6/README.md).

### Specification
Here is a modified version of the [header file](AddressBook.h) from the 
previous project. There are two (2) changes:
1. The `newAddressBook()` takes one parameter: desired size of the hash 
table
2. `displayStatisticsAddressBook()` will show statistics related to the 
hash table

### Files
* [First names](entries/first.txt)
* [Last names](entries/last.txt)
* [Addresses](entries/address.txt)
* [Email addresses](entries/email.txt)
* [Phone numbers](entries/phone.txt)


### Reminder
This is not a group project. You should not show anyone else your code and you
should not look at anyone else's code. Discuss ideas, not code. If you start
writing code down with someone else, you've gone too far.

### Style and Format
* Be sure to include appropriate documentation
* Format your code as discussed in previous classes

### Submission
* Submit your project using the eLearning dropbox
  * **No late submissions** will be accepted
* Submit a `.zip` archive containing all files necessary to run your program
  * Name your file argoID_project_#.zip (i.e. `kpo1_project_7.zip`)
