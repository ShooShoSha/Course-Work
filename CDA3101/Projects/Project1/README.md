# Project 1

## Number Conversions and Complements

### Name

### Objective
Show understanding of material from chapter 2. **Do not** use a calculator.

### Submission
Print a hardcopy showing your work (steps taken to get to your answer). Even if
you can perform the conversions in your head, show how you did by doing it in 
reverse.

### Due
Thursday January 23, at start of class

### Specification
1. Do these number conversions.
	* 118<sub>10</sub>
	* 1011 0011<sub>2</sub>
	* 36BE<sub>16</sub>
	* 239<sub>10</sub>
	* 10 1001<sub>2</sub>
2. Do this arithmetic:
	* 0101 0111<sub>2</sub> + 0011 0110<sub>2</sub>
	* 59A<sub>16</sub> - 2EC(sub>16</sub>
3. Assume you have an 8-bit two's complement computer. Show how the value
-91<sub>10</sub> would be stored in binary in that computer. Show all 8 bits.
4. Assume you have an 8-bit two's complement computer. Convert these values to
decimal. Note two's complement implies they could be either positive or 
negative.
	* 1010 1001<sub>2</sub>
	* 0111 0101<sub>2</sub>
