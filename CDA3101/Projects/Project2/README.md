## Floats and K-Maps

### Name ______________________________

### Objective
Show understanding of material in chapter and discussions in class.

### Submission
Print a hardcopy showing your work (steps taken to get to your answer). Submit
to instructor at beginning of class.

### Due
Tuesday February 4, at start of class

### Specification
1. Show how the value `-107.125` would be stored as a 32-bit floating point 
number. Give your answer in both binary and hexadecimal (Note: In hexadecimal
the 32-bits are simply converted to 8 hex digits).
2. Given the following truth table, generate the required sum of product terms
for the solution. Then draw the corresponding K-map simplified solution and the
resulting circuit diagram.
	X | Y | Z | Out | Sum of Products
	--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
	0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
	0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
