# Project 3

## Flip-flops and Memory

### Objective
Design and test circuits with [software](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/)

### Submission
Submit a `.zip` archive containing the three (3) circuits through eLearning
	* Name your archive with your Argo ID and project number
		* i.e. `kpo1_project_3.zip`
### Due
* February 27, before 5:00 PM
* February 28, before 5:00 PM (for late submissions)

### Specification
Build and test
1. Simple RS latch
	* Use two NOR gates for the implementation
2. RS master-slave flip-flop
	* Use two simple RS latches
	* Include a clock signal
3. 1-bit memory as it was designed in class
	* Start with RS master-slave flip-flop

### Notes
* In the software Logisim, make circuit 3 the _main_ circuit
* You **cannot** use any pre-built components from the the Logisim libraries
